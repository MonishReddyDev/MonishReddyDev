### 👋 Hi, I’m Monish Reddy  

**Backend-focused Full Stack Developer** who enjoys building **fast, scalable, and reliable systems**.

I have **4.5+ years of experience** working on **fintech platforms, digital payments, and real-time systems**, where performance, correctness, and uptime actually matter. I spend most of my time on the backend designing **low-latency APIs**, **event-driven microservices**, and **cloud-native services** but I’m comfortable stepping into the frontend when needed.

I care deeply about **clean system design**, **production-grade code**, and building software that scales without surprises.
