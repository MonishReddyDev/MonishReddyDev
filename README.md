👋 Hi, I’m Monish Reddy (@MonishReddyDev)
Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

I’m a Software Developer with 3+ years of experience, specializing in backend engineering with Node.js while also contributing to frontend development with React and TypeScript. I build scalable APIs, microservices, and cloud-native applications on AWS, delivering production-ready solutions with a strong focus on performance, reliability, and security.

🔍 Areas of Interest:
Backend Development
Designing and optimizing RESTful APIs with Node.js (Express.js , NestJs ), implementing event-driven systems, and ensuring performance under scale.

Frontend Development: Building responsive, reusable UI components with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, ensuring smooth frontend-backend integration.

Cloud & DevOps
Deploying cloud-native applications using AWS services like Lambda, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, EventBridge, and ECS. Familiar with Docker and CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

Distributed Systems & Microservices
Building microservices using Node.js, Flask, and Django, with integrations like RabbitMQ, Redis, and asynchronous job queues for resilient architectures.


📚 Currently Learning & Enhancing:
AWS Developer Associate Certification – Deepening serverless deployment and monitoring practices
Advanced backend scalability techniques (caching with Redis, API versioning, rate limiting).
Full-stack project development, enhancing frontend skills to deliver end-to-end solutions.
Improving serverless deployments and monitoring practices on AWS.
Open-source contributions in backend tooling, DevOps automation, and cloud infrastructure APIs.


🤝 Open to Collaborations On:
API & Microservice Development – With Python or Node.js
Cloud-native Backends – Serverless, containerized apps using AWS
Full-Stack Projects combining robust backends with clean, responsive frontends
Open Source Projects – Especially in backend tooling, DevOps automation, and infrastructure APIs


🚀 Always eager to learn, collaborate, and create efficient backend solutions!
